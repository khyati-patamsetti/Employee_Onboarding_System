# Phase 1 — Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

**Project:** Employee Onboarding System (Salesforce)

**Context:** I am a 4th-year student working on this project as part of TCS lastmile program and personal skill development. The aim is not to deliver to a client but to simulate a professional project that could be shown in my portfolio or used for future job opportunities. Phase 1 helps me understand the business and industry side of onboarding before jumping into the technical Salesforce build.

## 1. Requirement Gathering — learning by simulating

**Goal:** practice how professionals collect onboarding requirements and translate them into Salesforce features.

### My approach as a student

* **Research:** read HR and onboarding best practices from articles, whitepapers, and sample HR manuals.
* **Fictional interviews:** imagine conversations with HR, IT, and a new hire based on what I’ve seen or read.
* **Classroom experience:** reflect on how students are onboarded into internships or university programs.
* **Own experience:** think about my internship or part-time work onboarding (emails, paperwork, account setup).

### What I’ll gather

* Must-have steps: document signing, role-based access, task checklists.
* Nice-to-have steps: integration with learning modules, dashboards for managers.
* Pain points: manual processes, delays in access, lack of tracking.

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis — using personas

**Goal:** even though I don’t have real stakeholders, I’ll design realistic personas to simulate how professionals handle this.

### Example personas

* **HR Manager Persona:** wants compliance and visibility into progress.
* **IT Admin Persona:** wants automation in provisioning accounts.
* **New Hire Persona (student intern):** wants simple steps, less paperwork.
* **Legal Persona:** cares about signed documents and audit logs.
* **Myself (student builder):** cares about learning Salesforce automation and showing project depth.

## 3. Business Process Mapping — as-is vs to-be

**Goal:** map out how onboarding often works in real life vs how I’ll design it in Salesforce.

### As-is (imagined from student perspective)

* Emails with offer letters.
* Printing/signing contracts physically.
* IT creates accounts manually.
* HR uses spreadsheets to track tasks.
* No dashboards or real-time updates.

### To-be (my project design)

* Onboarding Plan created in Salesforce.
* DocuSign integration for e-signatures.
* Automatic assignment of permission sets by role.
* Tasks and training tracked in Salesforce.
* HR dashboard to monitor progress.

## 4. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis — academic exploration

**Goal:** understand how different industries approach onboarding so my design isn’t too narrow.

### Examples

* **Tech/SaaS:** remote onboarding, quick provisioning.
* **Healthcare:** compliance-heavy (training + certifications).
* **Finance:** strict audit, background checks.
* **Retail:** bulk hiring, mobile-friendly processes.

**How I’ll use this:** add notes in my design about which flows or checks are relevant per industry. Even if I don’t implement all, I’ll show awareness.

## 5. AppExchange Exploration — learning exercise

**Goal:** explore Salesforce marketplace solutions as if I were recommending them.

### Apps I’ll look at

* **DocuSign eSignature for Salesforce** (for contracts).
* **Learning apps or Trailhead-based solutions** (for training).
* **Background check apps** (just for analysis).

I’ll create a simple evaluation matrix with columns like: *App name | Purpose | Complexity | Cost (approx) | Pros/Cons*.
